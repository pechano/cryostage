# cryostage

Contained within the /cryostage repository is all the resources needed to use the Arduino powered cyostage by Johannes LÃ¸rup Buch.
This includes:
	The Arduino sketch
	EAGLE files for schematic and PCB
	Schematics of any lasercut objects used in the project
	The scientific poster used to present the project

The project was a part of my PhD thesis and anything contained here has been used purely for academic purposes.
